Git Hub Flow

We are going to create a master branch and a developer branch.
Pushes to the development branch are done after code is vetted by the team.
Pushes to the master branch are done by the owner of the repo and only after the team has vetted all features and branches.

Outline for the week:

Monday: Architecture Tuesday: Working Model Wednesday: MVP Thursday: Bug fixes and stretch goals Friday: Presentation

The work flow:

Git

1 Create a working branch off the developer branch using your first name
2 for every feature or bug that you are working on create a new branch:

    Drive-initials_Nav-initials_bug-name or feature-name

    Example: Drive-BP_Nav-JS_styleguide

3 Commits should include what was done by whom and why. BE SPECIFIC.
4 Commit every 30 min. get freaking timer if you have to
5 BEFORE MERGING ANYTHING
    Everyone push to the branch you are working on
    SWITCH TO THE DEVELOPER BRANCH
    git pull origin DEVELOPER
    SWITCH back to your feature branch
    carry on

For the issues list in gitHub follow these guidelines

MVP_Feature-name/bug-name/questions - then leave comments about specifics
STR_Feature-name/bug-name/questions - then leave comments about specifics

Daily Work Tasks

Start of Day

Check Slack communication
Pull down most recent push to the developer branch: git pull origin developer <-- NOT MASTER
Standup around 9:10am

Throughout the Day

Send updates to team members via Slack or verbally when you have completed a task
If you get stuck on something for more than 15 min. ask for help from a TA or team member
If you think you are ready to push your feature/bugfix to the development branch request a team meeting for vetting

End of Day

Save everything.
push changes to whatever feature branch you are working on
Go home and enjoy whatever beverage suits you.

General Notes:

Make sure you have all your files linked up in the html before you start tearing your code apart!
Lets use IFEE's so we don't have to worry as much about variable conflicts
